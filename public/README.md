# Public Assets Folder

Place your images here. They will be accessible at the root path of your application.

## How to use:
1. Add your image file (e.g., `before-design.jpg`) to this folder.
2. In your code (e.g., `components/Problem.tsx`), reference it like this:

```tsx
<BeforeAfterSlider 
  beforeImage="/before-design.jpg" 
  afterImage="/after-design.jpg" 
/>
```
